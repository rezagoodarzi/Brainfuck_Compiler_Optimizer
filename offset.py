    """Adds offsets to operations where applicable.

    Pointer positioning, i.e. < and > or Left and Right, can often be
    eliminated by providing offsets to other instructions. E.g.,
    ->>>++.>>->> becomes Add(2, 3) Out(3) Sub(1, 5) Right(7).

    This implementation will produce 7 consecutive Right(1) instead of
    a single Right(7) though. This is so to allow this optimization to
    be evaluated in isolation, without it also implementing
    contraction of Left/Right.
