### Running the Optimization Code

This guide explains how to run the BF optimization project, detailing the steps required to execute the code and understand the generated outputs.

#### **Prerequisites**
Before running the code, ensure you have the following:
1. Python installed on your system (version 3.7 or later).
2. A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a text editor).
3. Access to the project files, including the main optimization script and the `assets` directory.

---

### **Steps to Run the Code**

#### **1. Open the Main Project File**
Locate the optimized file in the project directory. This file serves as the entry point for the program. It handles the BF input code and generates the required outputs.

#### **2. Insert the BF Code**
1. Open the main project file(**`optimize`**).
2. Find the section labeled for inputting the BF code.
3. Replace the placeholder or existing code with the BF code you wish to compile.

#### **3. Execute the Code**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project file.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python optimize.py
   ```

#### **4. Access the Outputs**
After execution, the program generates the following outputs:

1. **`output.py`**:
   - The compiled and optimized Python code based on the provided BF input.

2. **Assets Directory**:
   - **`helloworld_notoptimized.py`**: Contains the unoptimized Python code generated from the BF program.
   - **`helloworld_optimized.py`**: Contains the optimized Python code, showcasing the enhancements made by the optimizer.
   - **`program.bf`**: A copy of the original BF code used during the compilation process.

### **Output Explanation**
1. **`output.py`**:
   - This file contains the final output of the BF-to-Python compilation process. It reflects the optimized version of the input code.

2. **`helloworld_notoptimized.py`**:
   - Demonstrates the direct translation of the BF program into Python without any optimization applied.

3. **`helloworld_optimized.py`**:
   - Highlights the optimizations applied to the BF program, showcasing the improvements achieved.

4. **`program.bf`**:
   - Stores the BF code you input into the main project file for reference and reuse.

---

### **Conclusion**
Running the BF optimization project is straightforward and results in multiple outputs that showcase both the unoptimized and optimized versions of the program. These outputs allow you to compare the effectiveness of the optimization techniques applied.
